## Introduction to Node.js

The `N` in `MEAN` stands for Node.js, and can be thought of as a replacement for the `A` in `LAMP`, otherwise known as Apache. The Node.js website describes it as "...a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices." 

In this class, we will be using Node.js to:
 
* Run an HTTP server
* Build out a RESTful API for managing the data within our mongoDB server
* Secure protected routes that require authentication
* Support OAuth credentials for Google, Facebook and Twitter
* More. . .

For a more in-depth overview of Node.js from it's creator, Ryan Dhal, view the following video:

## Getting Started

[Download Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) and install it on your system to get started. Let's look at the basic structure of an HTTP server and the steps to create it.
                                                                                              
First we require the `http` module. The http module is a built-in library written by the authors of Node. By requiring it, we can use their code in our application.

    var http = require('http');

Next, we create the server using the `createServer()` method of the http module:
      
      var server = http.createServer(function(request, response){
        // Read requests, write responses
      });
      
Finally, we tell the server what port to listen on:

      server.listen(9001);
      
To respond to the user, we can use the `write()` method of the response:

    response.write('Hello World');
    
To tell the server that the response has completed, call the `end()` method on the response:

     response.end();
      
##First http server

Create a new file named `app.js` and use the code above to create your first HTTP server. In the response, `write` the message "Hello world".

##NodeMon

Starting and restarting your server is a pain in the ass. If we want to make changes without having to constantly press ctrl + c (or cmd + c for mac) and then press 'node app.js', let's install a package called nodemon.
  
      npm install -g nodemon

Npm stands for Node Package Manager. The '-g' flag tells your computer to install this package globally. 

Now that we've got nodemon installed, go back to your terminal and type 'nodemon app.js'. Now when you make changes to your code, nodemon will automatically pick those up and you can refresh your browser to see those changes without having to stop and restart your server.

#Express

Express is the `E` in `MEAN` and represents the HTTP framework built on top of Node.js for faster, more robust support of building web servers.

##Getting started with Express

First, create a directory to hold your application, if you haven't already done so, and make that your working directory.

    $ mkdir sandbox
    $ cd sandbox

Create a package.json file in the directory of interest, if it does not exist already, with the npm init command.

    $ npm init
    
Install Express in the app directory and save it in the dependecies list:

    $ npm install express --save
    
To install Express temporarily, and not add it to the dependecies list, omit the --save option:

    $ npm install express

###Basic HTTP server in Express

Here is an example of a very basic Express app.

    var express = require('express')
    var app = express()
    
    app.get('/', function (req, res) {
      res.send('Hello World!')
    });
    
    var server = app.listen(3000, function () {
    
      var host = server.address().address
      var port = server.address().port
    
      console.log('Example app listening at http://%s:%s', host, port)
    
    });
    
Save the code in a file named app.js and run it with the following command.

    $ node app.js
    
Then, load [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in a browser to see the output.
